## Permissions

When you have dozens of browser tabs open at the same time, it's not easy to switch between them, and it's easy to close them by mistake.

### storage

Store recently closed browser tabs locally in the browser and use it for quick recovery.

在浏览器本地存储最近关闭的浏览器标签页数据，并用于快速恢复。

### tabs

Query all the tabs that meet the specified conditions to achieve tab search, filtering.

查询所有符合指定条件的标签页，实现标签搜索、筛选。

### history

Queries the user's browsing history today, assisting in finding and restoring recently closed or visited tabs.

查询用户今日的浏览历史，辅助查找和恢复最近关闭或访问过的标签页。

综上，以上权限均为实现扩展核心功能（标签页管理、历史恢复、数据持久化）所必需。
